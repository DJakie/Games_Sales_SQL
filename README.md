# Games_Sales_SQL
This project involved extensive data cleaning, sales performance analysis, and identifying key trends in the video game industry.

In the video game sales analysis project, the following tasks have been executed:

1. Data Cleaning:
   - Filled in missing values for columns like `Critic_Score`, `Critic_Count`, `User_Score`, `User_Count`, `Developer`, `Rating`, and `Genre` with placeholder values such as "Not Reviewed" or "Misc." for easier analysis.

2. Sales Analysis:
   - Identified the top 10 companies based on global sales and their percentage share of total sales.
   - Analyzed the contribution of different regions (NA, EU, JP, and Others) to the total sales for the top publishers.
   - Investigated the bottom 10 publishers' sales performance in each region.
   - Conducted sales analysis by platform and by genre, highlighting the top-performing genres.

3. Game Performance:
   - Identified the best-performing game for the top 10 publishers, along with details like reviews, developer, and ratings.
   - Analyzed the best-performing game year-wise based on global sales.
   - Investigated the number of games made in each rating category and identified the best games according to critic and user reviews.

4. Market Share Analysis:
   - Evaluated the regional contribution to global video game sales by examining the share of each region (NA, EU, JP, Others) in the global market.
